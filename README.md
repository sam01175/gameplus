This project was created and added for the purpose of my first work sample on GitHub platform as a front-end freelancer.
In this project, I used different programming languages ​​such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript so
 that I could add innovation in addition to the similarity between my sample and my template.
 All my efforts were to make it look interesting to you as the first work sample and to attract the satisfaction of other developers and employers.
 Like most front-end developers, I structured this project with HTML and styled it with CSS.
 In this way, I also used JavaScript and made some sliders with it to add to the beauty of the site.Of course, the difference and innovation between my project and the template site
 was the structure of these sliders and their design.
 For example, in some template sliders, the next and previous buttons of the slider did not change when hovering,
 but I added a hover style to them.
 I also put the source of the template here so that you can see the changes by comparing it with my project
 and guide me as a newbie if needed.
